# cookbook.rb

This is a cookbook app I've developed along with Campus Code and it's didactic playlist of projects.
It increased in my basic knowledge about Ruby and captivated me even more towards programming and system development.

This is the model of a social media based on the register of recipes.
It shows you options of adding a recipe into the menu, specify its type and see the recipes indexed in menu.

I'm working on it to make it complete and improve my knowledge!!!
